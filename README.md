# hello-world
My first repository on Github for "The Data Scientist's Toolbox" on Coursera from Johns Hopkins University.
<p> Hello, </p> 
<p> I am looking to go back to school to study Data Science. I am using this course on Coursera to get myse familiarized with basic concepts of Data Science, so that I have an idea of what I'll be getting myself into once I attend college. I am totally new to this field, and am enjoying my time studying so far. All of the information I'm learning is very, very interesting. </p>
<p> I initially had no interest in Data Science. I was looking for work in Data Enry at first. I wanted to gain more relevant work experience, so I searched for some courses that I could take on Coursera. From here, I was lead to the field of Data Analytics. I started studying Google's Data Analytics course on Coursera after encountering a video lesson on the various branches of data science : 
<p> analytics, </p> 
<p> statistics, </p> 
<p> and machine learning/AI </p>
<p> From here, I learned that I was less interested in the field of data analytics, and more interested the fields in statistics and machine learning, specifically statistics. This lead me to Johns Hopkins University's Data Science Specialization. So far, so good. I'm looking forward to learning.</p>
<p> Update : I have been running into a lot of issues using the help guide. I'm working through them, but it's taking me a lot of time. This is to be expected, I guess, but it's a little bit unnerving. Hopefully I can get a hang of this. This is a little bit like writing a score, I guess, so I know I can do it. </p>

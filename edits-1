<p> I am editing a branch called "readme-edits." I am not totally sure what I'm doing. This is going to take a lot, and I mean a lot of practice. I am very fascinated by all of this, however. </p>
<p> So, using the manual's intstructions, I made changes, committed those changes, pulled those changes, and merged them to the main branch. But I'm still confused. When I merge edits, how is this displayed on the main branch? The first sentence of the branch "edits-1" isn't showing up as merged with the main branch--Oh, so I guess I did this correctly. I was under the impression that all of the edits would be merged to one file, which I guess is not true. Ok, on with the course. </p>
